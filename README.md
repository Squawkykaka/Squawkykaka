I am a skilled programmer, specializing in Java and HTML, and I have a passion for developing new technologies. 
Recently, I set up a Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 GB of RAM to play with my friends. 
This project showcased my love for both programming and the game of Minecraft. 
Additionally, I enjoy coding Minecraft mods and exploring new ways to enhance the game experience, 
I'm also an avid reader, with my favorite book being Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
I maintain a Github account where I share my coding projects and contribute to open-source projects.
